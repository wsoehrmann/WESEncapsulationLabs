INSTRUCTIONS FOR LAB #2 ON ENCAPSULATION
===========================================

You are going to build a simple simulation of a video game. Don't worry, we're
not asking you to write the code for a complete game. What we we need is just
the skeleton code for part of the game. Therefore, we
won't be using too many classes or writing lots of functional code. We're
only interested in class construction with basic properties and some methods,
with only some bare bones implementation code (the body of the method)
to demonstrate mastery of the encapsulation principle. As a guideline, examine
the example4. That's about as much detail as you need.

Create the following classes:

1. A "GameCharacter" class
2. A "Game" class
3. A "GameBoard" or "GameWorld" class where your characters live
4. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) class for input/output
5. A Startup class with a main method

Provide at least 3 properties for each class, except for class #5.

Provide at least 3 methods for for each class, except for class #5. For class 5
you just need a main method. Make sure at least two of the methnods for classes
1-4 are to be completed in a specific order. Make sure at least
one method has one or more method parameters. To save time, you can just
put comments where code inside the method would go for complex operations,
such as validation logic.

The GUI class will not be a real GUI class. You will just fake it. This program
does not need to be runnable. We are only concerned about demonstrating
best practices for coding, following the five best practices discussed by
your instructor at our last class session.

Now use the "Startup" class to start your game. When you think you've done
things correctly, ask your instructor to review your code on screen. (Time
permitting). Should we run out of time, please print out the source code and
hand in at our next class. Make sure your name, course, date and "Lab2" are 
indicated in a comment at the top of the first page.
